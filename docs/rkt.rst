Working With rkt
----------------
The `rkt <https://github.com/rkt/rkt>`_ tool is a command line interface for
running application containers.

There is an introduction to using rkt in the :ref:`tutorial`. Alternatively,
you can see the `Getting Started with rkt`_ guide in the `rkt documentation`_.
If you are already familiar with Docker, then this Medium post about
`Moving from Docker to rkt`_ may also help you.

If you have followed the :ref:`tutorial` or are already running a rkt container
then the running container can be seen using the rkt list command.\

::

    $ rkt list
    UUID        APP             IMAGE NAME                      STATE   CREATED     STARTED     NETWORKS
    c7d3aaca    dev-rktmachine  woofwoofinc.dog/dev-rktmachine  running 6 days ago  6 days ago  default:ip4=172.16.28.2

Stop a running container using rkt stop.

.. NOTE::
   The rkt stop command is run as the superuser because root privileges are
   required to start/stop containers on a system. However, listing the
   containers as earlier is fine as a regular user since it only needs access
   to rkt management data, not kernel calls.

::

    $ sudo rkt stop c7d3aaca
    "c7d3aaca-8536-43f3-9b83-1ba8887b4fbb"

The container will show as exited in the list now.

::

    $ rkt list
    UUID        APP             IMAGE NAME                      STATE   CREATED     STARTED     NETWORKS
    c7d3aaca    dev-rktmachine  woofwoofinc.dog/dev-rktmachine  exited  6 days ago  6 days ago

Eventually, stopped containers can be removed by running rkt gc. This has a
grace period of 30 minutes where stopped containers are not removed. The
garbage collection can be forced by setting the grace period to zero with
``--grace-period=0s``.


::

    $ sudo rkt gc --grace-period=0s
    Garbage collecting pod "c7d3aaca-8536-43f3-9b83-1ba8887b4fbb"

    $ rkt list
    UUID        APP             IMAGE NAME                      STATE   CREATED     STARTED     NETWORKS


To see which container images are available to run, use rkt image list.

::

    $ rkt image list
    ID                  NAME                                SIZE    IMPORT TIME LAST USED
    sha512-e1e9e1991658 woofwoofinc.dog/dev-rktmachine      1.8GiB  6 days ago  6 days ago
    sha512-fdd18d9c2103 coreos.com/rkt/stage1-coreos:1.21.0 184MiB  6 days ago  6 days ago

It is common to start interactive containers for development workflows and
typically useful to mount directories, e.g. source code, from the host computer
via the NFS mount on the CoreOS VM.

An example is:

::

    $ sudo rkt run \
        --interactive \
        --volume rktmachine,kind=host,source=$(pwd) \
        woofwoofinc.dog/dev-rktmachine \
        --mount volume=rktmachine,target=/rktmachine \
        --exec /bin/bash

In this case, the current working directory is mounted onto the container. This
is a handy shortcut when already in an NFS mounted directory on the CoreOS VM.
On the container, this directory is available at ``/rktmachine``.

Use 'exit' to finish the interactive session.

.. NOTE::
   To exit a non-interactive container or a non-responsive interactive
   container, press Ctrl+] three times quickly.

To delete a container image entirely use rkt image rm. This will mean that new
instances of the container cannot be started until the container is
reinstalled.

::

    $ rkt image rm woofwoofinc.dog/dev-rktmachine
    successfully removed aci for image: "sha512-e1e9e1991658e3908f817164f01292ecaf44bed95e25167020c6cbe28d6b863b"
    rm: 1 image(s) successfully removed

The images can be garbage collected similarly to the running containers but
using the rkt image gc command instead.

::

   $ sudo rkt image gc


Building Containers for rkt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The rkt documentation contains a guide on `Building an App Container image`_
based on using acbuild_.

.. _Building an App Container image: https://coreos.com/rkt/docs/latest/trying-out-rkt.html#building-an-app-container-image
.. _acbuild: https://github.com/containers/build

The `acbuild documentation`_ contains detailed information on using the tool.
In particular, see the `acbuild Getting Started guide`_ and
`acbuild subcommand documentation`_.

.. _acbuild documentation: https://github.com/containers/build/blob/master/README.md
.. _acbuild Getting Started guide: https://github.com/containers/build/blob/master/Documentation/getting-started.md
.. _acbuild subcommand documentation: https://github.com/containers/build/tree/master/Documentation/subcommands

The ``examples`` directory of the `RktMachine repository`_ contains build
script examples using Ubuntu that illustrate how to use ``acbuild`` to make a
variety of containers for development use.

.. _RktMachine repository: https://github.com/woofwoofinc/rktmachine

.. CAUTION::
   Most services do not default to listening to all network interfaces. Instead
   they typically just listen on the localhost network. This is a problem when
   specifying service to run inside a container because the localhost network on
   the container will not be available outside of the container. This means we
   cannot access the container service from our host computer.

   Most services have command line options to change the network interface on
   which the service listens. Usually, it is sufficient to change this to be
   the ``0.0.0.0`` interface, i.e. listen on all network interfaces on the
   container. This will then include the external network interface which our
   host computer will use to attempt to connect to the container.
